		<p>In the fall of 2020, life finally felt like it was returning to some sense of normalcy, however, a lot of us continue to be hesitant to go out. Concerns around safety, cleanliness, and overall comfort with being around others have become major factors in consumer decision making.</p>
		<p>Despite the government and World Health Organization developing with regulations for operating safely, some businesses were adhering to the rules better than others. Unfortunately, the consumer has limited ways to know if a business is compliant or non-compliant with said regulations.</p>
		<p>Based on responses to a series of yes or no questions, AWhere will calculate a percentage score representing the overall safety of a business. It utilizes php and SQL to collect the data and run the corresponding queries.</p>
		<p>While AWhere is currently only equipped to serve Wolfville, Nova Scotia and the restaurants in the community, the goal one day will be to make it available to anyone anywhere.</p>
		<p>This application was developed as part of the 4th Year Capstone Project at Acadia University by Maddy Cain.</p>
